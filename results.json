'They're observing,' he rasped, his voice a grinding avalanche. \u2018They see the patterns in your waddle, Bartholomew. Patterns leading to\u2026a deeper understanding of the inevitable return to stillness.\u2019 He then produced a perfectly formed icicle, sharpened to a point like a question mark, and held it aloft.

The humor arises from the escalating horror \u2013 the bizarre rituals (the icicle), disturbing visions of shifting ice floes and implied vastness of Antarctic history, and Bartholomew's increasingly erratic behavior. The tone is darkly humorous and surreal, with elements of cosmic horror as Silas reveals fragments of his horrifying past - a forgotten explorer trapped within the glacier, essentially forever observing the endless cycle of destruction and renewal.",

The humor comes from the escalating horror and the gradual breakdown of both characters."
